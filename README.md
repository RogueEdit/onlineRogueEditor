## FAQ

- How do i revert my changes?
  - The programm will always create backups everytime you login! When you load the first time it will create a `base_[trinerID].json` unique based on your trainerID. All subsequent backups will be named `backup_YearMonthDay_HourMinuteSeconds.json` and you can restore to any file back in time.
